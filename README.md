**Which client will subscribe to a term deposit? - Predictive Analytics on the imbalanced Bank Marketing data.**

## Background
The increasing number of marketing campaigns over time has reduced their effects on the general public. The possible reasons for the reduced effect of marketing campaigns could be, 
1. Due to competition, positive response rate to mass campaigns are typically very low. According to a recent study, less than 1% of the contacts will subscribe a term deposit.
2. Direct marketing has drawbacks, such as causing negative attitude towards banks due to intrusion of privacy. In order to save costs and time, it is important to filter the contacts but keep a certain success rate.

## Problem Statement
The data is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The objective is **to build a classifier to predict whether or not a client will subscribe a term deposit.** 

If the classifier makes good predictions, the banks can arrange a better management of available resources by focusing on the potential customers “picked” by the classifier, which will improve their efficiency. Besides, finding out which factors are influential to customers’ decision will aid in designing a precise campaign strategy, to help to reduce the costs of the bank and improve the profits.
