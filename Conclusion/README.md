#### Recommendations based on the feature importance plot:

- According to the plot, **the most influential features are nr.employed, emp.var.rate_grp, age, cons.conf.inx, cons.pric.inx, 
previous_success and campaign** that contribute positively to the overall success of the bank marketing campaign.
- “nr.employed”, which is the **number of employees in the bank**, has **positive effect** for turning people to subscribe the term deposit.
This can be due to the fact that the more employees the bank have, the more influential and prestigious this bank is.
- "emp.var.rate_grp" has an influence on the subscription. This makes sense because the employment rate is an indicator of the 
macroeconomy. **A stable employment rate** denotes a **stable economic environment** in which people are **more confident to make
their investment**. 
- "age" definitely influences the subscription as the **middle aged people can be the more willing customer to spend their money on 
financial tools**.
- **CCI and CPIs** are the ones that will **determine the expenditure and saving of a customer in a month**. So they will definitely influence the subscription.
- Also **clients who responded positively to previous similar campaigns have the tendency to subscribe** to the current campaign, and hence should be contacted and given priority.

Therefore, if the bank wants to improve their lead generation, they should hire more people to work for them, 
target the relevant age group people and previous positive clients and run their campaigns when interest rates are high and
macroeconomic environment is stable.
